# Frontend Rules

## Tailwind CSS v4

- No `tailwind.config.js` — all tokens defined in `@theme inline` in CSS only.
- No `@apply` — use component extraction or direct utilities instead. `@apply` defeats the purpose of utility-first and creates hidden coupling.
- Dark mode via CSS variables in `@theme`, not by duplicating color classes.

## Components

- One component per file.
- Props type colocated: inline in the same file or in `[name].types.ts` alongside — never in a separate global types file.
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoint prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).

## Accessibility

- Interactive elements must have accessible labels (`aria-label` or visible text).
- Semantic elements always — no `div` for buttons or links.
