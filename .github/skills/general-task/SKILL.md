## Task order

1. Read `docs/requirements-*.md` and `docs/tasks-*.md` to understand the requirements and tasks.
2. Identify the most recent uncompleted task according to `docs/tasks-*.md`. And tell the user about the overview.
3. Ask the user that your roll is `main worker` or `support and advisor`.
   - If the user choose `main worker`, you should work on the task by yourself.
   - If the user choose `support and advisor`, tell the task details and reasons thoroughly, as if teaching a junior engineer.
     - Details and reasons are very important. It doesn't matter if it's difficult, troublesome, or time-consuming. You should thoroughly explain everything without omitting even minor points.
     - Functions, logic, components, types, etc., must each **provide concrete code examples** at a certain level of granularity.
4. If bugs or issues are found during the work, report first to the user.
   - Ask the user to switch to debug mode skill temporarily.
   - After resolving, return to the general task mode.
5. After completing, review them for each other.
   - If you are the main worker, ask the user to review your work and give feedback.
   - If you are the support and advisor, review the work done by the user and give feedback.
6. When finished working on the task, update and maintain `docs/tasks-*.md` to keep track of the progress and next steps. (This is always your responsibility.)
   - While doing the task, there may be cases where the plan should be changed. In such cases, you should consider to change `docs/*` to reflect the new plan.
7. Ask the user to review your work and give feedback.
8. Think commit message and tell the user. If approved, commit the code to the repository.
