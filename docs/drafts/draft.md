This is draft of portfolio v3.

## overview

This PJ has already installed packages, and created minimum files.
So requirement and tasks docs should be created to follow this environment.

## design

There is wire frame [image](docs/drafts/portfolio-v3-wire.png)  
This wire is just atomospheric, color scheme can be changed.

- `public/` has header image.
- use simple color scheme, only single main mode based on dark.
- don't use any hover effect
- don't use any animation, icons
- keywords: simple, minimal and quiet text based design

## pages

- home(has about, posts and tools overview)
  - header fixed on top and it has navigation links ( doesn't dicide mobile version yet )
  - footer fixed on bottom
- about unique page is not decided yet
- posts is list of posts posts, each post has unique page
- tools doesn't have unique page, just links from home

## additional features

- posts posts can be tagged, and tags can be filtered
- contact form is not needed now, link to X is enough, MVP at least.
- admin page for adding posts posts, it will be created in future
- need to connect github, deploy automatically on push to main branch

## others

Actually I aleady have portfolio v2 site, so we should transfer GA4 (GTM) settings to new site.  
Also I have custom domain, so we should set it to new site.  
They are controled in Cloudflare.  
But I don't know how to do them yet.  
These tasks will be done after site is ready.
